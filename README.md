# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

I’ve started this project to analyze customer shopping patterns. The goal is to understand how customers shop, what influences their buying decisions, and how businesses can use this information to improve sales and customer engagement.

## Current Progress

So far, I’ve:

- Added the **dataset** (`customer_shopping_behavior.csv`)
- Created a **Jupyter notebook** for analysis
- Completed **data cleaning and preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values and nulls
  - Renamed columns for consistency
  - Created new columns: `age_group` and `purchase_frequency_days`
  - Removed redundant columns

Next steps will include:

- Further **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **SQL-based analysis** for additional insights
- **Power BI dashboard** to visualize patterns
- **Actionable insights and recommendations**

This repository will grow step by step as the project progresses.
