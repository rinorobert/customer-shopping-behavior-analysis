# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes customer shopping patterns to uncover insights into purchasing behavior, spending trends, and the factors influencing buying decisions. The objective is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that support data-driven business decisions using an end-to-end analytics workflow.

## Project Scope & Objectives

~ Understand how different customer segments contribute to revenue  
~ Analyze the impact of discounts, subscriptions, shipping types, and loyalty  
~ Identify high-performing products and categories  
~ Segment customers based on purchase history and behavior  
~ Uncover trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
~ Communicate insights through interactive dashboards

## Current Progress

### Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

~ Dataset added: `customer_shopping_behavior.csv`  
~ Data cleaned and preprocessed using Python  
~ Missing and null values handled  
~ Columns renamed for clarity and consistency  
~ New features engineered: `age_group`, `purchase_frequency_days`, `customer_segment`  
~ Redundant and irrelevant columns removed  

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

~ Distribution analysis of age, gender, purchase amount, and frequency  
~ Revenue trends across customer segments and age groups  
~ Behavioral comparison of subscribed vs non-subscribed customers  
~ Impact of discounts and shipping types on spending  
~ Visualizations created using Matplotlib and Pandas  
~ Insights documented clearly alongside plots in the Jupyter notebook  

---

### Database Integration

~ Connected Python to PostgreSQL  
~ Loaded the cleaned dataset into relational tables using SQLAlchemy  
~ Performed analytical queries directly on PostgreSQL  

---

### SQL-Based Analysis (PostgreSQL)

~ Revenue comparison by gender  
~ Spending behavior of subscribed vs non-subscribed customers  
~ Impact of discounts on purchasing behavior  
~ Comparison of average purchase amounts across shipping types  
~ Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal  
~ Analysis of repeat buyers and subscription likelihood  
~ Product- and category-level performance analysis  
~ Revenue contribution by different age groups  

All SQL queries and explanations are documented inside the Jupyter notebook.
