# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

I’ve just started this project, and for now, I’ve only added the Business Problem Statement.
The goal of this project is to understand how customers shop, what influences their buying
decisions, and how businesses can use this information to improve sales and customer engagement.

As I continue working on it, I’ll be adding:

- Data cleaning & preparation (Python)
- SQL-based analysis
- A Power BI dashboard
- Insights and recommendations

This repository will grow step by step as the project progresses.
